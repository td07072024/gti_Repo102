The barrage was constructed by Hindustan Construction Company. Out of 109 gates, 108 are over the river and one over the low-lying land in Malda, as a precaution. The Barrage serves water to the Farakka Super Thermal Power Station. There are also 60 small canals which can divert some water to other destinations for drinking purposes, etc.
