Farakka barrage has been criticized for the floods in Bihar as it is causing excessive siltation in the Ganga.[11]

Farakkha barrage also greatly reduced fish migration up the Ganga river. Adult sea fish, like the Hilsa fish usually breed in fresh water river. After Farakkha Barrage was built, there were no llfish migration fish ladders built to provide spawning area for the fish. After the building of hilsha fish dwindles greatly in India, while the fish thrived in the lower Padma river river in Bangladesh.

After the construction of the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal, the maximum flows in the Ganga-Padma River were reduced significantly. The flow reduction caused many problems in India and Bangladesh, including the loss of fish species, the drying of Padma's distributaries, increased saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal, and damage to the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans.[12]

Starting in 2016, some fish ladders have been built on the Farakkha barrage
